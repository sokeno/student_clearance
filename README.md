# online-student-clearance-system
The current process of applying for a college clearance is tedious and time
consuming. A college clearance has to be signed by the heads of every
department. Most of the time, department heads are not in their respective
offices. They have classes to teach or meetings to attend. Because of this,
students requesting for college clearance are left with no choice but to wait
for at least a few hours to have their college clearances issued.

This system aims to minimize that wait time. In a few clicks, students can have
their clearance released.
